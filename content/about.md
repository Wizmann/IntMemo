# About IntMemo

IntMemo is a online tool to help you remember.

"We remember we forget.", as the famous singer-songwriter, rapper, farmer and wizard Jason Mraz said. We always forget things and it's quite common in our life. IntMemo using the [forgetting curve] theory to help remember everything.

I know exactly may be this theory is a bullshit. But I think to have a hints of remembering might do some trick to our brain. And it's worth to take a shot.

I make this online app using Python, AngularJS, Bootstrap and some other powerful tools. And it's a pure static website which hosts on Github Pages. So we take a command-line client to update our processes and records. But I'm too lazy to write a user manual. Maybe I will add something later on.

Hope you like it.
